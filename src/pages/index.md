    Tayside Airgun Club was formed in the spring of 2000 by a group of like
    minded people who needed a safe, secure and reliable place to shoot at
    static targets. Auchterhouse Country Sports was able to provide all of these
    and, thanks to their support, the Club has flourished, becoming one of
    Scotland's leading airgun clubs.


    We also hold Corporate Events on behalf of Auchterhouse Country Sports, and
    host youth organisation team bonding events. Corporate or bonding, these
    events can become very hotly contested. Several of our members compete, with
    some success, in Scottish HFT competitions and in STS pistol events.


    The Club is affiliated to Scottish Target Shooting, UK Association for
    Hunter Field Target, and National Small-Bore Rifle Association. Tayside
    Airgun Club is approved and certificated by Police Scotland.
