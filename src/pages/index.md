    Tayside Airgun Club was formed in the spring of 2000 by a group of like
    minded people who needed a safe, secure and reliable place to shoot at
    static targets. Auchterhouse Country Sports was able to provide all of these
    and, thanks to their support, the Club has flourished, becoming one of
    Scotland's leading airgun clubs.


    As well as regular club meetings and competitions several of our members
    compete, with some success, in Scottish HFT competitions and in various
    pistol events. We also hold Corporate Events on behalf of Auchterhouse
    Country Sports, and host youth organisation and team bonding events. 


    The Club is affiliated to Scottish Target Shooting and is approved and
    certificated by Police Scotland.
