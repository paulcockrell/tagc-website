    description: >-
      A real collector's item.  Serial number 954, which dates it to the early
      1900's.  The grips are brown Bakelite.  There is surface corrosion on the
      trigger, which would polish out.  The pistol still shoots well and has
      plenty of power.  The seller is asking Â£200 but is open to very near
      offers.
