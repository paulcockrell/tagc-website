### Who can join?

Membership of Tayside Airgun Club is open to all, providing that legal requirements are met.

### Legal Requirements

The law makes no distinction between air guns and more powerful guns and all are classed as Firearms. This means that any offence committed can carry a very heavy penalty. There are at least 38 different offences, but the main points are:.

#### Power

* Air rifles must not exceed 12 foot-lbs muzzle energy.
* Air pistols must not exceed 6 foot-lbs muzzle energy.

### Licensing

You must have an  Air Weapons Licence (AWL) to own or transport an airgun in Scotland, but most people can use an airgun without an AWL, under supervision, at a recognised club like Tayside.

See <https://www.mygov.scot/air-weapon/> or contact the club if in doubt.

### Age restrictions

There are restrictions on the possession and use of air guns for people under the age of 18 and further restrictions for those under the age of 14.  In particular, under-18's cannot buy, hire or own an air gun but they can use one under supervision.

See <https://www.mygov.scot/air-weapon/>or contact the club if in doubt.
