  title: Why Kaldi
  description: >
    Kaldi is the coffee store for everyone who believes that great coffee
    shouldn't just taste good, it should do good too. We source all of our beans
    directly from small scale sustainable farmers and make sure part of the
    profits are reinvested in their communities.

  Kaldi is the ultimate spot for coffee lovers who want to learn about their
  java’s origin and support the farmers that grew it. We take coffee production,
  roasting and brewing seriously and we’re glad to pass that knowledge to
  anyone.

    Tayside Airgun Club was formed in the spring of 2000 by a group of like
    minded people who required a safe, secure and reliable place to shoot at
    static targets. Auchterhouse Country Sports was able to provide all of these
    and, thanks to their support, the Club has flourished, becoming one of
    Scotlands leading airgun clubs.


    We also hold Corporate Events on behalf of Auchterhouse Country Sports, and
    host youth organisation team bonding events. Corporate or bonding, these
    events can become very hotly contested. Several of our members compete, with
    some success, in Scottish HFT competitions.


    The Club is affiliated to Scottish Target Shooting, UK Association for
    Hunter Field Target, and National Small-Bore Rifle Association. Tayside
    Airgun Club is approved and certificated by Police Scotland.

    We hold our coffee to the highest standards from the shrub to the cup.
    That’s why we’re meticulous and transparent about each step of the coffee’s
    journey. We personally visit each farm to make sure the conditions are
    optimal for the plants, farmers and the local environment.
